# Trivy Security Scan Exceptions
# DevOps Assignment - LenDenClub Project
# ===========================================
#
# The following security checks are intentionally ignored
# as they are REQUIRED for a public-facing web application.
#
# Date: 2025-12-25
# Reviewed by: Krish (DevOps Engineer)
# ===========================================

# ACCEPTABLE: Egress to public internet (0.0.0.0/0)
# Reason: EC2 needs to download packages, security updates, and connect to external services
# Risk Level: LOW for outbound traffic from trusted instances
AVD-AWS-0104

# ACCEPTABLE: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ingress from public internet
# Reason: This is a PUBLIC web application that must be accessible globally
# Risk Level: NONE - This is the intended functionality
# Ports: Only 80 and 443 are open (SSH is restricted to admin IP)
AVD-AWS-0107

# ACCEPTABLE: S3 bucket using AWS-managed keys (AES256) instead of customer-managed KMS
# Reason: AES256 provides sufficient encryption for this use case
# Risk Level: LOW - Data is still encrypted at rest
# Note: Customer-managed keys add complexity without significant security benefit here
AVD-AWS-0132

# ACCEPTABLE: Public subnet auto-assigns public IP addresses
# Reason: EC2 instance MUST have a public IP to be accessible as a web server
# Risk Level: NONE - This is required for the application architecture
AVD-AWS-0164
